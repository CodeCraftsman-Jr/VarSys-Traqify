# üîê Security Guide for Traqify

This document outlines the security measures implemented in Traqify and provides guidelines for secure deployment and usage.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Credential Management
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: All sensitive credentials are loaded from environment variables
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No API keys, passwords, or tokens are stored in source code
- **Template Files**: Example configuration files with placeholder values
- **Secure Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when credentials are not configured

### ‚úÖ Version Control Security
- **Comprehensive .gitignore**: Excludes all sensitive files and directories
- **Credential File Exclusion**: Firebase configs, OAuth tokens, and session files are never committed
- **User Data Protection**: Personal data directories are excluded from version control
- **Build Artifact Exclusion**: Compiled applications and installers are not tracked

### ‚úÖ Configuration Security
- **Multi-layer Configuration**: Environment variables ‚Üí .env file ‚Üí config files (in order of preference)
- **Validation and Warnings**: Clear warnings when using less secure configuration methods
- **Auto-generated Values**: Derives configuration values when possible to reduce manual setup
- **Configuration Validation**: Checks for missing or invalid configuration

## üö® Security Checklist for Deployment

### Before Going Public
- [ ] All sensitive credential files removed from repository
- [ ] .gitignore updated to exclude all sensitive files
- [ ] Environment variable system implemented and tested
- [ ] Template configuration files created
- [ ] Setup documentation written and verified
- [ ] Security warnings added to configuration loading

### Firebase Security
- [ ] Firebase Authentication enabled with Email/Password provider
- [ ] Realtime Database security rules configured
- [ ] Service account keys stored securely (not in repository)
- [ ] API keys restricted to specific domains/IPs in production
- [ ] Regular credential rotation schedule established

### Google OAuth Security
- [ ] OAuth credentials stored in environment variables only
- [ ] Redirect URIs configured for production domains
- [ ] Scopes limited to minimum required permissions
- [ ] Client secrets never exposed in client-side code

### Production Deployment
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for all connections
- [ ] Environment variables configured on hosting platform
- [ ] Debug mode disabled in production
- [ ] Logging configured to exclude sensitive information
- [ ] Regular security updates scheduled

## üîß Secure Configuration Guide

### Environment Variables Priority
1. **System Environment Variables** (Highest Priority)
2. **.env File** (Development)
3. **Configuration Files** (Legacy/Development Only)

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# Firebase (Required)
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your_project.firebasedatabase.app
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Google OAuth (Optional)
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
GOOGLE_OAUTH_PROJECT_ID=your_google_project_id
```

### Hosting Platform Configuration

#### Replit
1. Use the "Secrets" tab in your Repl
2. Add each environment variable as a key-value pair
3. Never use .env files in Replit (they're visible to collaborators)

#### Render
1. Go to your service's Environment tab
2. Add environment variables in the dashboard
3. Use the "Add from .env" feature for bulk import (then delete the .env file)

#### Heroku
```bash
heroku config:set FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
heroku config:set FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
# ... add all other variables
```

## üö´ What NOT to Do

### ‚ùå Never Commit These Files
- `config/secure_firebase_config.json`
- `data/google_tasks_credentials.json`
- `data/google_tasks_token.json`
- `data/config/firebase_session.json`
- `.env` (except `.env.example`)
- Any file containing API keys, tokens, or passwords

### ‚ùå Never Hardcode Credentials
```python
# DON'T DO THIS
api_key = "AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

# DO THIS INSTEAD
api_key = os.getenv('FIREBASE_API_KEY')
```

### ‚ùå Never Share Credentials
- Don't paste credentials in chat, email, or documentation
- Don't screenshot configuration with real values
- Don't commit credentials "temporarily" (they stay in git history)

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Regular Security Tasks
1. **Credential Rotation**: Rotate API keys and secrets every 90 days
2. **Access Review**: Review Firebase and Google Cloud access logs monthly
3. **Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated for security patches
4. **Configuration Audit**: Regularly verify no credentials are exposed

### Security Incident Response
1. **Immediate**: Rotate all potentially compromised credentials
2. **Investigate**: Check access logs for unauthorized usage
3. **Update**: Change all related passwords and API keys
4. **Monitor**: Watch for unusual activity for 30 days

## üìû Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in Traqify:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. **DO NOT** post details in discussions or forums
3. **DO** email security concerns to: [your-security-email]
4. **DO** provide detailed information about the vulnerability
